            <i><p> Video games have been around since 1947 with the first version of this being made by  by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and they issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992. Inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.
            since then there have been many different companies revolutionizing the way we play. For example some of the first consoles made were from Atari and Sega. Which were then surprassed by Nintendo and Sony. After the Playstation 2 released by Sony was made, Microsoft joined in by creating the Xbox. Although consoles are one of the more popular ways to play, there are still other ways to play such as handheld games, pc, mobile, and VR.
            With many ways to play these games there are even more genres that these games fit into, some of the more popular genres include  sports games and first person shooters, even with these genres there are sub-genres that go with them such as soccer games and Call of Duty respectively. With the industry contnuing to grow companies are pressured to continue to innovate and create something new every year to satisfy the players. Video games 
            have been a vital part of many children growing up as that was the only passtime they had and with new innovations and games coming every year the video game industry continues to grow and show up in our everyday lives.</p></i>
